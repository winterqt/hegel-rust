# Getting started with Hegel for Rust

This guide walks you through the basics of installing Hegel and writing your first tests.

## Prerequisites

You will need [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed and on your PATH.

## Install Hegel

Add `hegel-rust` to your `Cargo.toml` as a dev dependency:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
hegeltest = "0.1.0"
```

## Write your first test

You're now ready to write your first test. Add the following to your tests:

```rust
use hegel::TestCase;
use hegel::generators::integers;

#[hegel::test]
fn test_integer_self_equality(tc: TestCase) {
    let n = tc.draw(integers::<i32>());
    assert_eq!(n, n); // integers should always be equal to themselves
}
```

Now run your tests. You should see that the test passes.

Let's look at what's happening in more detail. The `#[hegel::test]` attribute runs your test many times (100, by default). The `test_integer_self_equality` function takes a `hegel::TestCase` parameter, which provides a `draw` method for drawing different values. For each test case, the function then asserts that an integer value should be equal to itself.

Next, try a test that fails:

```rust
#[hegel::test]
fn test_integers_always_below_50(tc: TestCase) {
    let n = tc.draw(integers::<i32>());
    assert!(n < 50); // this will fail!
}
```

This test asserts that any integer is less than 50, which is obviously incorrect. Hegel will find a test case that makes this assertion fail, and then shrink it to find the smallest counterexample — in this case, `n = 50`.

To fix this test, you can constrain the integers you generate with the `min_value` and `max_value` functions:

```diff
 #[hegel::test]
 fn test_bounded_integers_always_below_50(tc: TestCase) {
-    let n = tc.draw(integers::<i32>();
+    let n = tc.draw(integers::<i32>()
+        .min_value(0)
+        .max_value(49));
     assert!(n < 50);
 }
```

Run the test again. It should now pass.

## Use generators

Hegel provides a rich library of generators that you can use out of the box. There are primitive generators, such as `integers`, `floats`, and `strings`, and combinators that allow you to make generators out of other generators, such as `vecs` and `tuples`. 

For example, here's how you might generate a list of integers:

```rust
use hegel::generators::vecs;

#[hegel::test]
fn test_append_increases_length(tc: TestCase) {
    let mut vector = tc.draw(vecs(integers::<i32>()));
    let initial_length = vector.len();
    vector.push(tc.draw(integers::<i32>()));
    assert!(vector.len() > initial_length);
}
```
<!-- TODO: more words -->



You can also define custom generators with the `composite` macro.

For example, say you have a `Person` struct that we want to generate:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    age: i32,
    name: String,
}
```

You can use `composite` to create a `Person` generator for this struct:

```rust
use hegel::generators::text;

#[hegel::composite]
fn generate_person(tc: TestCase) -> Person {
    let age = tc.draw(integers::<i32>());
    let name = tc.draw(text());
    Person { age, name }
}
```

To customize a generator further, you can make calls to `draw` in sequence that use the results of previous `draw`s. For example, say that you extend the `Person` struct to include a `driving_license` boolean field:

```diff
 struct Person {
     age: i32,
     name: String,
+    driving_license: bool,
 }
```

You can then draw values for `driving_license` that depend on the `age` field:

```diff
+use hegel::generators::booleans;

 fn generate_person(tc: TestCase) -> Person {
     let age = tc.draw(integers::<i32>());
     let name = tc.draw(text());
 -   Person { age, name }
+    let driving_license = if age >= 18 {
+        tc.draw(booleans())
+    } else {
+         false
+    };
+    Person { age, name, driving_license }
 }
```

## Automatically build generators for types

If you want a generator with no custom logic, as in the first `Person` example above, you can use the `derive` attribute to create a generator automatically:

```rust
#[derive(Generator, Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}
```

## Debug your failing test cases

Use the `note` method to attach debug information: 

```rust
use hegel::generators::{self, Generator};

#[hegel::test]
fn test_with_notes(tc: hegel::TestCase) {
    let x = tc.draw(generators::integers::<i64>());
    let y = tc.draw(generators::integers::<i64>());
    tc.note(&format!("x + y = {x + y}, y + x = {y + x}"));
    assert_eq!(x + y, y + x); // commutativity -- always true
}
```

Notes only appear when Hegel replays the minimal failing example.

## Change the number of test cases

By default Hegel runs 100 test cases. To override this, pass the `test_cases` argument to the `test` attribute:

```rust
use hegel::generators::{self, Generator};

#[hegel::test(test_cases = 500)]
fn test_integers_many(tc: hegel::TestCase) {
    let n = tc.draw(generators::integers::<i64>());
    assert_eq!(n, n);
}
```

## Next steps

- Run `just docs` to build and browse the full API documentation locally.
- Look at `tests/` for more usage patterns.
<!-- - Combine `#[derive(Generator)]` with `.with_<field>()` to generate realistic domain objects. -->
- See our [API docs](https://crates.io/crates/hegeltest).
