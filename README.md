`hegel-rust` is a property-based testing library for Rust. `hegel-rust` is based on [Hypothesis](https://github.com/hypothesisworks/hypothesis), using the [Hegel](https://hegel.dev/) protocol.

## Installation

To install: `cargo add --dev hegeltest`.

## Quick Start

A simple Hegel test:

```rust
use hegel::generators::integers;
use hegel::TestCase;

#[hegel::test]
fn test_addition_commutative(tc: TestCase) {
    let x = tc.draw(integers::<i32>());
    let y = tc.draw(integers::<i32>());
    assert_eq!(x + y, y + x);
}
```
