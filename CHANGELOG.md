# Changelog

## 0.3.1 - 2026-03-27

Improve generation and shrinking of `generators::hashsets` and `generators::hashmaps`.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-03-27

This release changes `self` in `#[invariant]` from an immutable reference to a mutable reference:

```rust
# before
#[invariant]
fn my_invariant(&self, ...) {} 

# after
#[invariant]
fn my_invariant(&mut self, ...) {}
```

This will require updating your invariant signatures, but should be strictly more expressive.

## 0.2.6 - 2026-03-26

Bump our pinned hegel-core to [0.2.3](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-core/releases/tag/v0.2.3), incorporating the following change:

> This release adds a --stdio flag to hegel-core that allows the calling process to communicate with it directly via stdin and stdout rather than going via a unix socket.
>
> As well as simplifying the interactions with hegel-core, this should enable easier support for Windows later.
>
> — [v0.2.3](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-core/releases/tag/v0.2.3)

## 0.2.5 - 2026-03-25

This release extends the tuples! macro to handle 1-tuples and 0-tuples correctly.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-03-25

This release moves over to using the new stdio version of hegel-core.
This should not be a user visible change.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-03-25

This release changes the way the client manages the server to run a single persistent process for the whole test run.

This should improve the performance of running many hegel tests, and also hopefully fixes an intermittent hang we would sometimes see when many hegel tests were run concurrently.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-03-25

This is a no-op release that fixes some publishing problems and has no user-visible changes.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-03-24

This patch improves the documentation for stateful testing.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-03-24

This release makes a bunch of last-minute cleanups to places where our API obviously needed fixing that emerged during docs review.

* Removes `none()` which is a weird Python anachronism
* Makes various places where we had a no-arg method to take a boolean to match `unique(bool)`
* Replaces our various tuplesN functions with a tuples! macro

## 0.1.18 - 2026-03-24

More updates and fixes to documentation.

## 0.1.17 - 2026-03-24

Add comprehensive API documentation, and hide various bits that shouldn't appear in the public docs.

## 0.1.16 - 2026-03-24

Better error message for when `uv` is not found on the PATH.

## 0.1.15 - 2026-03-23

Add `#[hegel::state_machine]` for defining stateful tests.

## 0.1.14 - 2026-03-23

Drop our dependency on the `num` crate.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-03-23

Enable the `#![forbid(future_incompatible)]` and `#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]` attributes, the latter of which unblocks our docs.rs build.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-03-20

This release improves derived default generators:

* Makes the derive method DefaultGenerator, not Generator, as that's what's actually derived.
* Brings the builder methods for derived generators in line with the standard convention, removing the with_ prefix from them.
* Fixes a bug where if you did not have `hegel::Generator` imported, DefaultGenerator would fail to derive.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-03-20

This improves error messages when uv is not installed.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-03-20

Adds support for the on-disk database, which automatically replays failing test.

Also adds the `hegel::Settings` struct to encapsulate settings.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-03-19

This patch bumps the minimum supported protocol version to 0.6.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-03-19

When the hegel server process exits unexpectedly, the library now detects this immediately and fails with a clear error pointing to `.hegel/server.log`, instead of blocking for up to 120 seconds on the socket read timeout.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-03-18

This patch adds support for outputting Hegel events as Antithesis SDK events.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-03-18

This release adds client-side support for reporting flaky test errors to the end user.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-03-18

This release updates the hegel-core version to support the new health checks feature.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-03-18

This release adds support for `HealthCheck`. A health check is a proactive error raised by Hegel when we detect your test is likely to have degraded testing power or performance. For example, `FilterTooMuch` is raised when too many test cases are filtered out by the rejection sampling of `.filter()` or `assume()`.

Health checks can be suppressed with the new `suppess_health_check` setting.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-03-18

Add a `#[hegel::composite]` macro to define composite generators:


```rust
use hegel::{TestCase, composite, generators};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    age: i32,
    has_drivers_license: bool,
}

#[composite]
fn persons(tc: TestCase) -> Person {
    let age: i32 = tc.draw(generators::integers().min_value(0).max_value(100));
    let has_drivers_license = age > 18 && tc.draw(generators::booleans());
    Person { age, has_drivers_license }
}
```

## 0.1.2 - 2026-03-17

Include both `hegeltest` and `hegeltest-macros` in a top-level workspace, to ease automated publishing to crates.io.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-03-17

Update our edition from `2021` to `2024`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-03-16

Initial release!
